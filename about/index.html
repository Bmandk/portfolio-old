            <h3>Game Designer</h3>
            <p>
                Video games has always been a part of my life. I have been gaming since I was 10. In 2012 I started on
                GameIT College, where my game development journey started. I learned to write code and focused on
                programming. I have experience with hardware, with Arduino and Raspberry Pi, and various sensors. This
                affords me to create custom hardware for the games I make (i.e. Guitar Hero controller). After this,
                especially when I started at the IT-University of Copenhagen, I got into game design. It was a lot more
                interesting, as dealing with people was a lot more unpredictable. With my strong background in
                programming, it places me as a strong core gameplay designer as I'm able to quickly prototype new games.
                In my future I'd like to get better at graphics and statistics/data analysis to become a better game
                designer.
            </p>
            <p>
                In my spare time, I play guitar and piano, hang with friends, watch mostly drama movies and series and
                enjoy snowboarding when possible.

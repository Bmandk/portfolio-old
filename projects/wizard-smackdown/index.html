                            Wizard Smackdown was the first bigger game project I was a part of. The game was developed while
                            on exchange in Seattle, USA in October 2014. The game involves 2 wizards fighting each other on top of a
                            very high pillar. To win you can use your spells to drain the opponent's health or push him
                            to the edge of the pillar.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The game was originally inspired after a Warcraft 3 mod called "Warlock". We had all enjoyed
                            playing it together, so we set out to recreate that. Creating a party game was also very
                            feasible within the month, as it doesn't require intricate systems or big levels/worlds for
                            players to have fun with the game. <br>
                            As we were creating a party game, we decided to go with controllers to play the game. We
                            only had Xbox controllers available, so we weren't able to test with different controllers.
                            We still had to figure out the control scheme to use. It was hard for us to decide
                            internally, so we decided to run playtests with the different versions. This worked well, as
                            one control scheme seemed to be the best and made it easy to choose.<br>
                            Spell design was another big part of the design. Players choose their own spells at
                            the start of the game, so we wanted all spells to be equally viable. We learned quite
                            quickly that it wasn't quite so simple. Firstly, changing one spell has an effect on other
                            spells, as playstyle and spell interaction also affects changes with spell changes.
                            Secondly, in hindsight I realized there is a lot more to balancing than just having 50% win
                            rate. Fairness, counterplay, enjoyment etc. all needs to be taken into account.

                            The goal of the project was to learn how to work on a larger project. We were 6 people
                            working on it for a month full time, with 3 people working in the industry as supervisors.
                            To organize the work, we used Scrum to make sure we the right tasks done in time. This
                            resulted in having a game that was finished without having to crunch. As part of the project,
                            we were also required to make a <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/959559550/1035666030?token=30f776e9">Kickstarter which can be found here</a>.

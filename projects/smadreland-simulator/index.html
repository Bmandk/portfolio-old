                    Smadreland Simulator can be roughly translated from Danish to "Destructionland Simulator",
                    which is exactly what it implies. It's a game about destroying as many things as possible,
                    as quickly as possible. Objects such as old cars and washing machines fall from the sky, and
                    weapons fall out of them when destroyed (You don't store your weapons in your washing
                    machine?) At the end, the devil appears and you have to beat him.

                    The game was the winner of a gamejam organized by <a href="https://www.copenhell.dk/">
                    Copenhell, the biggest danish hard rock and metal festival</a> with more than 20.000
                    attendees. I got together with 3 other guys and we set out to make the game. We knew we
                    would be right next to the real Smadreland at the festival (yes, it exists!). It's a pretty
                    iconic thing for Copenhell, who wouldn't want to take a giant sledgehammer to town on a car?
                    However, there
                    is an age limit, so we decided to make a virtual version of this. Since Smadreland was not
                    in the virtual world, we could add more extreme things, such as flamethrowers and
                    explosions. Furthermore, we assumed that the average festival goer was not a gamer, so we
                    made the game simple, with simple controls and systems. This was also because we didn't
                    expect them to play for more than a few minutes, so having a game that's easy to learn was
                    important. As it was so short, hard to master wasn't a goal we aimed for.

                    played with controllers. The game was also showed off at Copenhell, having a few hundred players who
                    enjoyed it tremendously.

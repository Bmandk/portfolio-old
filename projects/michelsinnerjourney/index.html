                    Michel's Inner Journey was a gamejam game made for <a
                        href="https://www.facebook.com/events/239244493547731/">Kaktus Jam</a>. The game was made from
                    the keywords "Upside Down" and "Anatomy". The concept was that the character's anatomy is inside
                    out, and the brain has to find way back to its body.
                </p>
                <p>
                    While the game itself is a fairly simple platformer, the controls were very different. Since this
                    was a game about the anatomy, we wanted to explore using the body to move the player. We didn't have
                    a VR headset available, so we had to hack our own together. This was done using a phone and <a
                        href="https://www.pubnub.com/">PubNub</a>, a simple networking library that works with Unity and
                    JavaScript. This paired with measuring accelerometer and gyroscope allowed the user to jump to
                    control the player.

                    however the game requires physical setup. So you'll have to do with the video.

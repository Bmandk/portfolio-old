                    The 4D Controller was an attempt to add more modalities to the interaction with screens. It was made
                    as a group exam project with 2 classmates for a hardware course. We designed and produced the PCB
                    from scratch,
                    soldering components and writing the code for it.

                    My responsibilities was PCB production and programming. We used an Arduino Uno together with our own
                    PCB to mount the various components. The starting point for the design was the standard PlayStation
                    2 DualShock controller. This means it had the same layout with buttons and analog sticks. Then we
                    added a fan and LED lights to the controller. The goal was for the fan to be able to blow wind in
                    the users face, so they can feel wind when playing games to be able to immerse them more. An example
                    could be while playing a motorcycle game it would have a lot of wind, but it could also be used for
                    ambient wind while playing RPGs. The LEDs were initially added to interact with mostly shooters,
                    and lighting up when e.g. a flashbang exploded in a game. We quickly figured out that the LEDs we
                    had were not strong enough to achieve this effect, but it still worked well for ambient lighting.

                    The controller attached to a computer was able to interact with Unity with a USB connection. The
                    application we built was only a demo to showcase that it worked. With more development, it would be
                    possible to make a driver and a library that developers can use to use the controller in a project.
